## Important note

**Important**
To make sure you can successfully run the latest versions of the example scripts, you have to install the library from source and install some example-specific requirements.
Execute the following steps in a new virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
cd transformers
pip install .
pip install -r ./examples/requirements.txt
```

This folder contains actively maintained examples of use of ðŸ¤— Transformers organized along NLP tasks. If you are looking for an example that used to be in this folder, it may have moved to the corresponding framework subfolder (pytorch, tensorflow or flax), our [research projects](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/research_projects) subfolder (which contains frozen snapshots of research projects) or to the [legacy](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/legacy) subfolder.
>>>>>>> 8d43c71a1ca3ad322cc45008eb66a5611f1e017e

While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in this folder are just examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs. To help you with that, most of the examples fully expose the preprocessing of the data. This way, you can easily tweak them.

This is similar if you want the scripts to report another metric than the one they currently use: look at the `compute_metrics` function inside the script. It takes the full arrays of predictions and labels and has to return a dictionary of string keys and float values. Just change it to add (or replace) your own metric to the ones already reported.

Please discuss on the [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) or in an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues) a feature you would like to implement in an example before submitting a PR: we welcome bug fixes but since we want to keep the examples as simple as possible, it's unlikely we will merge a pull request adding more functionality at the cost of readability.

## Logging & Experiment tracking

You can easily log and monitor your runs code. The following are currently supported:

* [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
* [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.com/library/integrations/huggingface)
* [Comet ML](https://www.comet.ml/docs/python-sdk/huggingface/)

### Weights & Biases

To use Weights & Biases, install the wandb package with:

```bash
pip install wandb
```

Then log in the command line:

```bash
wandb login
```

If you are in Jupyter or Colab, you should login with:

```python
import wandb
wandb.login()
```

Whenever you use `Trainer` or `TFTrainer` classes, your losses, evaluation metrics, model topology and gradients (for `Trainer` only) will automatically be logged.

When using ðŸ¤— Transformers with PyTorch Lightning, runs can be tracked through `WandbLogger`. Refer to related [documentation & examples](https://docs.wandb.com/library/integrations/lightning).

### Comet.ml

To use `comet_ml`, install the Python package with:

```bash
pip install comet_ml
```

or if in a Conda environment:
